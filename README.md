# commitcenter_bot
This little TG-bot is your faithful guardian of the Code Universe! It secretly spies on GitHub repositories (even private ones, if you plant a token), throws stylish alerts into the channel. Juggles a bunch of repositories, scans cheerfully every 5 minutes and hides cozily in Docker with data persistence. A true Commit Master with a cosmic vibe!
